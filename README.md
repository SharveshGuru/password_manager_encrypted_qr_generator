ABSTRACT:

We all know that passwords play an important role in today’s digital world. Without it you can forget about even accessing the internet. Situations may arise when there’s a need for you to share the password to a trusted one. You may trust the person you are sharing to but won’t trust the technology by means which you’re sharing. That’s why our team has come up with an idea to create a password manager and a QR code generator. The QR code will contains the credentials in an encrypted format which can only be decoded by the receiver. In this way, even if somehow your QR code is exposed outside, there would be no need for worrying as it is already encrypted and cannot be misused.
